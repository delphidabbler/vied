Source Code Licensing
=====================

This document reviews the relevant licenses governing the Version Information
Editor source code available from DelphiDabbler.com and the Subversion
repository on Google Code at
http://code.google.com/p/verinfo-tools/source/browse/.

The source code includes:

+ Original Source Code written by Peter Johnson.
+ Image files.

The download does not include all the source code required to build Version
Information Editor. Explicitly it doesn't include:

+ Source files from the Delphi VCL. You must have Delphi in order to access
  these files.
+ DelphiDabbler library components and units. These are all available from
  http://www.delphidabbler.com/software/vied/download


Original Source Code
--------------------

Original source files are stored the "Source" directory and its sub-directories.

Any original source code file that is governed by a license has a comment to
that effect in the source. The exception is that .dfm files are considered to be
governed by the same license as the associated .pas file.

Where files are auto-generated (such as the .cfg file), and there are no
copyright or license comments in the files, the licensing of the file depends on
how it was generated. If the file was generated from another source file then
the generated file is covered by the same license as the originating source
file, if any. Otherwise the file is placed in the public domain.

Any other source code files that contain no copyright or license information are
public domain.

Many files are licensed under the Mozilla Public License. A full copy of that
license can be found in MPL.txt


Image Files (.ico, .bmp, .gif)
------------------------------

The images used in the program are stored in the "Source" directory and its
sub-directories.

Images may also be embedded in forms by various VCL controls. Separate image
files are not provided in this case.

All images are either original or have been copied or adapted from various
sources. With the exception of the images listed under "Exceptions" below, all
images are believed to be in the public domain and can be re-used without
restriction.


### Exceptions

The file "Source\Assets\VIEd.ico" is copyright (C) 2009 Peter Johnson (www.delphidabbler.com).

This file may not be altered in any way and may not be used in any other
programs, including programs derived from the Version Information Editor code
base, unless explicit permission is given by the copyright holder.

This means that if you modify an aspect of the Version Information Editor code
base and publish your changes then you must remove the icon or replace it with
your own.
