--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v1.0 of 25 May 1998  - Original version. Named EdNum.pas.
v1.1 of 13 Apr 1999  - Removed glyphs from buttons in form. Removed code from
                       form creation event that turns glyphs off. This was
                       incompatible with Delphi 2.
v2.0 of 18 May 2000  - Renamed as FmNumberEd.pas.
                     - Re-wrote dialog box to descend from TGenericOKDlg.
                       Removed all code for functionality that is now provided
                       in base class. This change also meant that button style
                       and font face now conformed to Windows 95+ standards.
                     - Removed call to utility function HexToInt since SysUtils
                       StrToInt function handles hex.
v2.1 of 17 Mar 2003  - Replaced reference to VInfoExp.inc help topic include
                       file with reference to UHelp unit.

v1.1 of 17 Mar 2003  - Replaced reference to VInfoExp.inc help topic include
                       file with reference to UHelp unit.
v1.2 of 25 Aug 2003  - Fixed bug that was always switching on start-up complier
                       check even when user specified otherwise. (While the
                       option to switch off the check is in a descendant dialog
                       box, some of code in this unit was reversing that choice.
                       We now only restore the start up checking if the user has
                       deleted an existing resource compiler reference.)
v1.3 of 04 Dec 2003  - The default command line suggested when the user
                       specifies BRCC32 as the resource compiler now wraps the
                       <BIN> and <SRC> placeholders in quotes in case there are
                       spaces in the file names used.

                       and font face now conformed to Window 95+ standards.
v3.0 of 06 May 2002  - Re-wrote dialog box. Instead of displaying two list
                       boxes, one for included and one for excluded items,
                       dialog box now uses a checked list box where items are
                       checked to represent set membership.

v1.2 of 24 Apr 1999  - Adapted string editor dialog box to allow controlling
                       units to set limit (or have no limit) on length of

                     - Introduced new WrapLines property to determine whether
                       the dialog box wraps lines of text at edge of control or
                       continues a line until return is keyed. In the latter
                       case a horizontal scroll bar is displayed.
v1.3 of 25 Apr 1999  - Added new FixedWidthFont property that sets font in memo
                       area to be mono-spaced when true and to font used by rest
                       of dialog box when false.
                     - Added new MemoWidth and MemoHeight properties to allow
                       width and height of memo component to be varied.
                     - Altered the Arrange method to arrange the dialog box
                       components to take account of variable size of memo
                       component.

                       and font face now conformed to Windows 95+ standards.
                     - Modified code that arranges and sizes window to work
                       with the built in arangement mechanism inherited from
                       TGenericOKDlg.

                       files.

                       their private supporting routines).
                     - Modified the CheckDrive function since it calls Windows
                       API GetTempFileName function which has a different
                       definition in Win32 than it has in Win16. Used
                       conditional code to allow for different ways of handling
                       this function.
v2.1 of 17 Mar 2002  - Changed to 32 bit only code. Removed all conditional
                       compilation directives and 16 bit specific code.

                     - Removed redundant CheckDrive and HexToInt routines.
                     - Changed to use private variable instead of typed constant
                       to store hex symbol type.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v1.0 of 25 May 1998  - Original version. Named VerUtils.pas.
v1.1 of 13 Apr 1999  - Removed reference to StrUtils library unit since the
                       required routines are now all in this unit.
                     - Made inclusion of Ver unit conditional since it only
                       exists under Delphi 1.
v1.2 of 17 Mar 2002  - Removed all conditional compilation directives and 16
                       bit-only code. Program is now 32 bit only.
v1.3 of 06 May 2002  - Added definition of EVersionError exception (formerly
                       in Vertypes).
                     - Now use TPJVersionNumber type in place of TVersionNumber
                       from old VerTypes unit.
                     - Removed usage of VerTypes unit.
                     - Removed unused routines.
                     - Replaced direct calls to raise exception with error
                       routine call.
                     - Now uses resource strings for error messages.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v1.0 of 25 May 1998  - Original version. Named VInfo.pas.
v1.1 of 13 Apr 1999  - Removed reference to library unit StrProc: required
                       functions are now in the project's own Utils unit.
                     - Made usage of Delphi 1's Ver unit conditional: unit
                       doesn't exist in Delphi 2.
                     - Conditionally included 32bit\winver.inc in compilations
                       using Delphi 2 to provide required constants that come
                       from Ver unit under Delphi 1.
v1.2 of 15 Apr 1999  - Fixed bug in TVInfo.GetStrPermitted method of TVInfo
                       class. This wasn't testing for ProductVersion string
                       properly and returning a random result in this case.
                       This was causing 32bit version of the program to believe
                       that the ProductVersion was not permitted if present, but
                       required when not present!
v1.3 of 24 Apr 1999  - Changed file load and save routines to preserve
                       indentation in comments in .rc and .vi files.
v1.4 of 25 Apr 1999  - Removed space that was being written to file in front of
                       comments in VI file, so as not to further indent comments
                       in .vi and .rc files.
v1.5 of 17 Mar 2002  - Removed all conditional compilation directives and 16
                       bit-only code. Program is now 32 bit only.
                     - Removed reference to WinVer.inc: values it defines are
                       defined by Windows unit.
                     - Changed default OS type from VOS_DOS_WINDOWS16 to
                       VOS__WINDOWS32.
                     - Deleted unused constant.
v1.6 of 06 May 2002  - Now use TPJVersionNumber type in place of TVersionNumber
                       from old VerTypes unit.
                     - Removed usage of VerTypes unit.
v1.7 of 17 Mar 2003  - Changed default VI and RC comments to use new program
                       name and to credit DelphiDabbler.
v1.8 of 18 Nov 2003  - Added ResOutputDir property to store default file output
                       folder used when compiling .res files and added facility
                       to read and write the property in .vi files.
v1.9 of 20 Apr 2008  - Renamed as UVInfo.pas.
                     - Changed to use renamed UUtils and UVerUtils units.
                     - Renamed as UVInfo.pas.
                     - Localised string literals as resource strings.

================================================================================
3: BUG FIXES
================================================================================
32bit version of program is treating ProductVersion resource string as not being
permitted whenever supplied and, quite rightly, treating it as a required string
when not present!
  o Fixed v2.1

Indentation in comments is being lost when a VI file is re-loaded.
  o Fixed v2.2

Indentation of comments is being increased by one additional space.
  o Fixed v2.3

When no resource compiler has been specified the program always prompts the user
to enter details at start-up, regardless of whether user has checked the box
requesting that the prompt not be shown.
  o Fixed v2.9.1

If no file extension is specified when saving .vi files the program does not
append one -- this is non-standard behaviour.
  o Fixed v2.10.1

The BRCC32 compiler was failing when passed file names containing spaces.
  o Fixed v2.10.1 by
    (a) making the default parameter string for BRCC32 wrap the command line
        parameters in quotes and
    (b) adding a note to the help file noting that users should do the same when
        manually adding command lines
