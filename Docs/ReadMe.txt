1) License and Copyright
------------------------

This is open source software. A full copy of the license can be found in the
file License.rtf that is installed in the main program installation folder.


2) System Requirements
----------------------

Version Information Editor requires Windows XP or later.

The program's memory and hard disk requirements are modest and any computer
capable of running the required operating system will be suitable.


3) Installation
---------------

Version Information Editor is installed using a standard Windows, wizard based,
setup program. This should be named VIEd-Setup-9.9.9.exe, where 9.9.9 is
replaced by the program's version number.

The setup program is usually distributed in a zip file that also contains this
read-me file. This zip file will be named vied-exe-9.9.9.zip, where 9.9.9 is the
same version number noted above.

Extract the setup program from the zip file and run it to install the program.

Please note that administrator privileges are required to run the installer. You
may be prompted for permission to run the setup program and may need to provide
an administrator password.

---------------

Version Information Editor can be uninstalled two ways:

Either:
  Open the application settings app appropriate to your version of Windows,
  locate DelphiDabbler Version Information Editor in the list of installed
  programs and select the remove option;

Or:
  Locate and open the "Version Information Editor" entry on the Start menu then
  click "Uninstall Version Information Editor".

The uninstaller will now run. Follow the prompts and provide administrator
authorisation as required. Version Information Editor will now be unistalled.
