1) License and Copyright
------------------------

This is open source software. A full copy of the license can be found in the
file License.rtf that is installed in the main program installation folder.


2) System Requirements
----------------------

Version Information Editor requires Windows XP or later.

The program's memory and hard disk requirements are modest and any computer
capable of running the required operating system will be suitable.


3) Installation
---------------

Version Information Editor is installed using the setup program. This should be
named VIEd-Setup-9.9.9.exe, where 9.9.9 is replaced by the program version
number.

The setup program is usually distributed in a zip file that also contains this
read-me file.

Extract the setup program from the zip file and double click it to run.

Please note that administrator privileges are required to run the installer. On
Vista and later the program may also require elevation.

The setup program is a standard wizard based installer, with the following
pages:

* Welcome page - press "Next" to begin the installation.

* License page - read the license and select the "I accept the agreement" radio
  button if you are happy with it. Then press "Next" to continue.

* Destination Location page - choose a directory where you want to install the
  program, or just accept the default. Press "Next" to continue once you've made
  your choice.

* Ready to Install page - displays the options you've chosen. Use "Back" to go
  back if you want to change anything, or press "Install" to go ahead.
  Installation now starts and a progress bar is briefly shown before the final
  page is displayed.

* Completion page - informs that the install has completed. This page gives the
  option of starting the program and displaying this read-me file. Deselect the
  options by un-ticking the adjacent check box. Click "Finish" to close the
  wizard. VIEd is now installed.


4) Uninstalling
---------------

To uninstall Version Information Editor open the control panel and start the
"Programs and Features" applet (a.k.a "Add/Remove Programs"). Locate
DelphiDabbler Version Information Editor in the list of installed programs and
click the remove button. The uninstaller will now run, asking you to confirm
that you want to uninstall.

Note that the uninstaller requires administrator privileges. On Vista and later
the uninstaller may also require elevation.
