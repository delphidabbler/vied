Version  Information Editor (vied)
==================================


Description
-----------

Version  Information Editor enables version information to be edited. It also creates version information resource source (.rc) files. The program stores details of the version information in its own project (.vi) files. Simple macros can be used to help automate the updating of version information files.

The program can also create binary resource (.res) files containing version information. To do this it needs to use a 3rd party resource compiler such as Borland's BRCC32.

From version 2.11 the program supports a command line switch - `-makerc` - that silently creates a .rc file from a native .vi file passed on the command line. The program simply creates the .rc file and exits, without displaying a window. This option has been made available to enable Version Information Editor to be used in automated build processes.


### System Requirements

VIEd requires Windows XP and later.


Source Code
-----------

VIEd is written in Object Pascal and targeted at Delphi 2010, although any later non-Unicode compiler should suffice.

See `Build.html` in the repo root for information about how to build the program from code.

Each release from v2.11.2 is has a tag in the form vX.X.X where X.X.X is the release version number.


Contributing
------------

Contributions are welcome.

I use the [GitFlow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) branching model. All development is done either directly on the `develop` branch, or on feature branches off `develop`.

To contribute please fork the project and create a new branch off `develop` that is named `feature/your-feature-name`. Create a pull request when you're ready.
