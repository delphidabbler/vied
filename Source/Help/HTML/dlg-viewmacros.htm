      View Macros Values Dialogue Box
    </h1>
    <p>
      This dialogue box is displayed when the user chooses the
      <span class="menuref">File | View Macro Values</span> menu option.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dialogue displays either one or two tabs: the <em>Macros</em> tab
      and the <em>Warnings</em> tab, which is only displayed if there are
      warnings.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the currently defined <a href="whatis-fields.htm#macros">macros</a>
      are displayed in the <em>Macros</em> tab, along with their values. The
      macros are displayed in a table.
    </p>
    <p>
      Any externally referenced files that can't be found are noted in the
      <em>Warnings</em> tab.
