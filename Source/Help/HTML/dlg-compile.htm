      Compile To File Dialogue Box
    </h1>
    <p>
      This standard Windows dialogue box appears when the user chooses the
      <span class="menuref">File  | Compile</span> menu option and no default
      compiler output folder has been specified.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dialogue box is used to enter the name and path of the compiler output
      file. It is recommended that file names with extension .res are used.
