    <h1>
      <em>How do I</em> ... Edit a document
    </h1>
    <p>
      You must first choose the document you wish to edit. This can either be
      a <a
        href="howto-newdoc.htm"
      >new document</a> or you can open an existing document either by using the
      <span class="menuref">File | Open</span> menu option or by dragging the
      file from Windows Explorer and dropping it on the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are four different aspects of the document that can be edited.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Version information
    </h2>
    <p>
      This is the most important aspect of the document and is displayed in the
      main window. This is divided into three distinct parts, each of which is
      described below.
    </p>
    <p>
      Version information items under each heading can be edited individually
      either by double clicking the item or by selecting it and choosing the
      <span class="menuref">Edit | Current Item</span> menu option or pressing
      <span class="smallcaps">F2</span>. A dialogue box suitable for editing the
      selected item is displayed.<br><a
        href="howto-edititem.htm"
      >Learn more</a>.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Fixed File Information
    </h3>
    <p class="indent">
      The fixed file information items are numeric items, flags or bit-masks
      that define the file and product version numbers, the target operating
      system, the application type and some optional flags that provide further
      information about the build.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Translation Information
    </h3>
    <p class="indent">
      This section contains information about the language and character set
      used in the executable file.
    </p>
    <h3>
      String Information
    </h3>
    <p class="indent">
      This section contains string file information. There are 12 predefined
      entries each of which is labelled in the display. Each can take up to 128
      characters of text.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      The editor supports special <a
        href="whatis-fields.htm"
      >fields and macros</a> that can be inserted into string information items
      to enable the text to be automatically updated with the value of the
      field/macro. This is the most powerful feature of the Version Information
      Editor and greatly eases the updating of version information
      resources.<br><a
        href="howto-fields.htm"
      >Learn how to use fields</a>.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Limitations
    </h3>
    <p>
      Although the version information specification allows for more than one
      translation and a separate string file information section to be
      associated with each translation, this program supports only one
      translation and one string file information section.
    </p>
    <p>
      Custom string file information entries are also permitted but not
      supported by the program.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Identifier
    </h2>
    <p>
      Although not strictly required, an <a
        href="whatis-identifier.htm"
      >identifier</a> for the version information
      resource can be specified.<br><a
        href="howto-editid.htm"
      >Learn more</a>.
    <h2>
      Version Information File Comments
    </h2>
    <p>
      <a
        href="howto-commentvi.htm"
      >Comments can be specified</a> that are added to the top of saved <a
        href="whatis-vifile.htm"
      >version information files</a>.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Resource file comments
    </h2>
    <p>
      <a
        href="howto-commentrc.htm"
      >Comments can be specified</a> for inclusion in generated <a
        href="whatis-resfile.htm"
      >resource source files</a>.
