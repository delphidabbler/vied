      Comments Editor
    </h1>
    <p>
      This dialogue box appears when the user chooses the
      <span class="menuref">Edit | RC Comments</span> or
      <span class="menuref">Edit | VI Comments</span> menu options.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dialogue box displays any existing comments of the selected type in a
      multi-line edit box. The existing comments can be either edited, replaced
      or deleted. Comments can be multi-line. Pressing return in the dialogue
      box enters a new line in the edit box - it doesn't close the dialogue box.
      Click <em>OK</em> to accept the changes.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can resize this dialogue as required.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Note:</strong> Comments will appear at the head of a <a
        href="whatis-resfile.htm"
      >resource source file</a> delimited by /* and */ symbols or in a <a
        href="whatis-vifile.htm"
      >version information file</a> preceded by a ';' symbol. These symbols
      should not be included in the text entered in the dialogue box. The text
      is not validated.
