    <h1>
      User Setup Dialogue Box
    </h1>
    <p>
      This dialogue box allows the user to specify the state in which the
      program starts up. It is accessed using the <span class="menuref">Options
      | User Setup</span> menu option.
    </p>
    <p>
      The options are specified by ticking or unticking check boxes, as follows:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <em>Automatic validation</em> &ndash; sets the initial state of the
        <span class="menuref">Options | Automatic Validation</span> menu item.
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>Describe the file flags in main windows</em> &ndash; sets the
        initial state of the <span class="menuref">Options | Describe File
        Flags</span> menu option.
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>Use UTF-8 as the default encoding for .vi files</em> &ndash; ticking
        the box causes UTF-8 to be used as the default encoding for new projects
        while clearing the box causes the system default ANSI encoding to be
        used.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Click <em>OK</em> to accept any changes.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Note:</strong> The <em>Automatic validation</em> and <em>Describe
      the file flags in main windows</em> settings take effect the next time the
      program is started. The <em>Use UTF-8 as the default encoding for .vi
      files</em> setting takes place the next time a new project is started: it
      doesn't affect the current project.
    </p>
