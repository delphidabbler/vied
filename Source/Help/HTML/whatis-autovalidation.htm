      <em>What is</em> ... Auto-validation
    </h1>
    <p>
      When automatic validation is switched on invalid information in a <a
        href="whatis-vifile.htm"
      >version information file</a> is corrected as the file is loaded. This
      also applies to the preferences used when creating a new document.
    </p>
    <p>
      Additionally while editing the current document while automatic validation
      is switched on:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        The user is warned when an attempt is made to delete string information
        that is compulsory.
      </li>
      <li>
        The &quot;Private Build&quot; and &quot;Special Build&quot; strings can
        only be edited if the appropriate File Flags are set, otherwise any
        values assigned to these string items will be deleted.
      </li>
      <li>
        Inappropriate File Sub-Types are inhibited. (Valid File Sub-Types are
        dependent on the File Type).
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      When automatic validation is switched off many of these checks are not
      carried out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Automatic validation can be switched on or off using the
      <span class="menuref">Options | Automatic Validation</span> menu option.
      The default setting for this feature can be set in the <a
        href="dlg-setup.htm"
      >User Setup</a> dialogue box.
