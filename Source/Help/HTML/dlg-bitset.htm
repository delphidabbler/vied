      This dialogue box appears when you edit either of the File Flags or File
      Flags Mask FIXED FILE INFO items.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dialogue box has a checked list box that displays all available flags.
      Those items which are included in the set are checked. To change which
      flags to include in the set check and uncheck items as required.
    </p>
    <p>
      Click <em>OK</em> to accept your changes.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Note:</strong> the symbolic constants available when editing File
      Flags are determined by those in the File Flags Mask bit set. Even if this
      dialogue box is cancelled and <a
        href="whatis-autovalidation.htm"
      >automatic validation</a> is switched off the entries in the File Flags
      bit set will be validated and corrected to reflect any recent changes to
      the File Flags Mask.
