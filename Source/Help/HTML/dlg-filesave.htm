      Save File Dialog Box
    </h1>
    <p>
      This standard Windows dialogue box appears when the user chooses the
      <span class="menuref">File | Save As</span> menu option, or
      <span class="menuref">File | Save</span> when the file has not yet been
      saved.
    </p>
    <p>
      It allows the user to choose file in which to save the current document as
      a <a
        href="whatis-vifile.htm"
      >version information file</a>. The file must have a .vi extension.
      After saving the file name appears in the window caption and will be used
      each time the <span class="menuref">File | Save</span> menu option is
      chosen.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the .vi extension is not used an error message is displayed and the
      file is not saved.
