      Export File Dialogue Box
    </h1>
    <p>
      This standard Windows dialogue box appears when the user chooses the
      <span class="menuref">File | Export</span> menu option. It is used to
      choose the name, path and type of file to be exported.
    </p>
    <p>
      Select the required type of file using the drop-down list of file types.
      Available types are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <em>Resource source files (.rc):</em> the current document is exported
        in <a
          href="whatis-resfile.htm"
        >resource source file</a> format with the .rc extension. Use the
        <span class="menuref">File | View RC Statements</span> menu option to
        see what the contents of the file will look like.
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>Resource binary file (.res):</em> the current document is exported
        in binary resource format with the .res extension, ready for inclusion
        in an executable file. <strong>Note:</strong> This file type is only
        available if a resource compiler has been <a
          href="howto-rescompiler.htm"
        >registered</a> with the program.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      If an invalid extension is entered an error message appears and the
      operation is cancelled.
