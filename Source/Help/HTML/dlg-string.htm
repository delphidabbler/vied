    <h1>
      String Information Editor
    </h1>
    <p>
      This dialogue box appears when you edit any STRING INFO item for which
      editing is currently permitted. You can resize this dialogue box if you
      need a larger area in which to enter strings.
    </p>
    <p>
      The current value of the string is displayed in a multi-line edit box at
      the top of the dialogue box. The string can be edited as desired.
      <strong>Note:</strong> Pressing return doesn't enter a new line of text
      but may close the dialog box. This is because STRING INFO text must be on
      one logical line.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a
        href="whatis-fields.htm"
      >Fields and Macros</a> can be entered in the text as follows:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Place the cursor where the field/macro is to be entered in the text.
      </li>
      <li>
        Select the required field/macro from the <em>Insert Field</em> drop-down
        list. This list contains all valid fields/macros for the STRING INFO
        item being edited.
      </li>
      <li>
        Click the <em>Insert</em> button.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Fields and macros can also be entered by typing them directly into the
      text, enclosing the name by angle brackets. To enter a &lt; character in
      the text it must be entered as &lt;&lt;&gt;.
    </p>
    <p>
      Click <em>OK</em> to accept your changes. Any trailing spaces are trimmed
      from the returned strings
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Note:</strong> When <em>OK</em> is clicked the entry is validated.
      If an unknown field or macro is encountered an error message is displayed.
      Dismissing the error message returns you to the dialogue box with the
      erroneous field/macro highlighted ready for correction. If <a
        href="whatis-autovalidation.htm"
      >automatic validation</a> is switched on and no text (ignoring spaces) has
      been entered for a required STRING INFO item then a warning is displayed
      with the option of ignoring the warning or returning to the dialogue box
      to enter some text.
