    <h1>
      Choose .vi File Encoding Dialogue Box
    </h1>
    <p>
      This dialogue box appears whenever you save a .vi file. It appears after
      you have chosen the file name and after any file overwrite permission is
      granted.
    </p>
    <p>
      It allows you to choose which encoding is used when the file is saved.
      There are two encoding options, chosen by selecting either the
      <em>ANSI</em> or <em>UTF-8</em> radio buttons.
    </p>  
    <p>
      The radio button that is selected by default when the dialogue box opens
      is the same as the encoding noted in the main window caption.
    </p>
    <p>
      Click <em>OK</em> to accept your choice. The file will be written with the
      chosen encoding. Clicking <em>Cancel</em> causes the save operation to be
      cancelled.
